# **Kanban-Board-Project Quicksell-Frontend-Assignment**
Hi everyone, I am Abhinav Sharma, 4th year undergrad at DTU. I made a Kanban Board using pure css and react js only as mentioned in the assignment of QuickSell.
Hope you like it.

# **Description**

An interactive Kanban board application built with React that interacts with the [QuickSell API] (https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment).
## Technologies
- React
- Redux
- Axios
- React-Icons
- React-Router

# Special Features
--> The application offers three distinct ways to group the data:

1. **By Status**: Groups tickets based on their current status.
2. **By User**: Arranges tickets according to the assigned user.
3. **By Priority**: Groups tickets based on their priority level.

--> Users are also able to sort the displayed tickets in two ways:

1. **Priority**: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority.
2. **Title**: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.

--> Application has an interactive UI and responsive design.
--> Additionally, the application saves the user's view state even after page reload.
